An interactive Excel dashboard built to simulate Security Operations Center (SOC) performance tracking. Designed to visualize alert volume, mean time to respond, severity distribution, and SLA adherence.

## 📊 Features
- **Alerts by Severity** – Pie chart breakdown of High/Medium/Low.
- **Top 5 Alert Types** – Bar chart of most frequent detections.
- **MTTR Trends** – Line chart showing Mean Time to Triage and Resolve over months.
- **SLA Compliance** – % of alerts resolved within 60 minutes.
- **Interactive Slicers** – Filter by Severity, Status, and Month – all charts update dynamically.

## 🧪 Data
500 rows of simulated alert data with the following fields:
- Timestamp, Alert Type, Severity, Status, Time to Triage (min), Time to Resolve (min)

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Download `SOC_Alert_Data.xlsx`
2. Open in Excel (2016 or later recommended).
3. Enable macros? Not needed – all PivotTables and slicers are pre‑connected.
4. Use slicers to explore different views.
